Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Danny Solomon, I am going to use this github to start documenting the projects I am working on starting August 2024. For past project I have worked on you can go to my past [github account](https://github.com/422dsolomon)

## 💻 Current Project
### ⏱ Silver
- Silver is an all in one platform that brings the modern tech suite to seniors
- Website: [Silver](https://silverhelps.com/)

## 🎥 Past Project
### 🐣 Wingman
- Wingman tackles the frustration with traditional dating apps by introducing an AI-powered wingman that interacts with you like a friend. It learns your personality, matches you with compatible people, and lets you view photos or continue chatting with matches. If you’re not interested, just return to talking with your wingman. Wingman moves beyond swiping by focusing on meaningful conversations, making dating more genuine and personalized.
